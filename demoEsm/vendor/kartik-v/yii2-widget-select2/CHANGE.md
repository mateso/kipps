version 2.0.0
=============
**Date:** 09-May-2015

Major revamp to the widget. Version bumped to release v2.0.0.

- (enh #27): Updates Select2 plugin to release v4.0. The following additional functionalities and changes should be expected with this new release:
    - New `theme` property that allows you to set themes in Select2 to style your widget.
    - A brand new theme by Krajee `Select2::THEME_KRAJEE` is specially styled for Select2. This will help achieve various new yii2-widget-select2 features. This theme matches the bootstrap 3 styling with enhancements.
    - Additional themes provided in form of `Select2::THEME_DEFAULT`, `Select2::THEME_CLASSIC`, and `Select2::THEME_BOOTSTRAP`. One can add their own custom theme and configure the widget.
    - No more `query` plugin property needed. It is also not mandatory to configure `data` even if you have not set `tags` or `query` or `ajax`. Widget will intelligently evaluate the properties and default list values.
    - Enhanced tagging support. Use it just like a multiple select but with taggable values. In addition, one can create tags on the fly.
    - Enhanced ajax support. Refer the [demos](http://demos.krajee.com/widget-details/select2) for details.
    - The `initSelection` method of Select2 3.5.x plugin is obsolete/removed. New `initValueText` property is been provided with the Select2 widget to cater to this (e.g. for ajax based loading).
    - Ability to disable selective option values in the Select2 dropdown OR add HTML attributes to selective options.
    - Enhancement by Krajee to disable the search box to use like a normal select.
    - Enhancements to locales and translations. Allow multiple language Select2 widgets on the same page.
